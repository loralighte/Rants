# Web 3.0 is an Authoritarian Nightmare
This is a quick rant, but I wanted to scream this out into the world somewhere.
Web 3.0 is an authoritarian nightmare. NFTs, blockchain content, and cryptocurrency
are not the future of freedom, but leading to a utopia. Wait, aren't utopia's good?
No. Utopia is inherently dystopia, which TL;DR while things look good on the surface,
under the surface to maintain a utopia requires totalitarian ideals to protect the image
of the utopia. 

The Web 3.0 being promised is authoritarian, with the idea being around "ownership". 
Copyright was already bad enough, but intelectual property being protected technologically
is insanity. Why? Because *most* intelectual property is evil. What Web 3.0 promises is an
NFT ridden nightmare hellscape where content is exclusively owned like physical private property,
which has never been seen before. 

I am not saying we have to pay to see content, or that artists don't deserve money,
but the problem is the ownership. Let's take a video from YouTube for example, one can
critisize it, parody it, and a lot of other things while still in the ownership of the
original creator. When it comes to NFTs... art dies. You know billionaires? How they have
their "artist" friends put a couple of lines on a canvas and call it "abstract art", then
use it for tax write offs? Imagine anyone can be that billionaire and artist, while also losing
money.

Art is no longer open, because even though copyright is also an inherit evil, it's one
with protections that can allow for expansion by other artists. Art is like a mustard seed,
one artist makes something small, another expands on it, and another expands on that. It continues
expanding until there is a whole universe. 

Openness is what art is about, art is about interpretation, and NFTs don't fully
appriciate that. Think of an NFT like this, you make something, and one person fully
owns the ART ITSELF. Not a physical copy, but all the rights, and can sort of controll
how it grows in order to make a profit. You essentially (and legally questionably) sell
your art to die as a stock option of sorts. This closes art.

I know this is an incoherent mess, but oh well.
