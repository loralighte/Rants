# Rants
Where I post public tech rants

This is not a blog, nor really meant to recieve feedback. Just somewhere for me to throw my ideas onto a markdown file so I can later use them for more acedemic papers and for later improvement. No, I will not accept any pull requests, even if it is for spelling mistakes or grammatical issues. This is all highly informal.
