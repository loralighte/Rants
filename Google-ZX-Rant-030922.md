# Atwood's Law
Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript. That means *everything*.

Google ZX is something I just recently discovered, though existing around the past year. It's a replacement of BASH with JavaScript.

Google ZX is stupid enough as an idea, but Atwood's law sadly does apply.

It still upsets me that ZX exists, even if BASH is terrible. It's not that ZX is bad, but rather that JavaScript angers me as a programming language.

This wasn't too long of a rant but I needed to express my opinion.
