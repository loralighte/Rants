# Web 3.0 is a scam.
Web 3.0 is the so-called future of the internet, but in reality is simply a scam designed to screw over old people into thinking Bitcoin and Etherium are the most important parts of our future. My proof? The definition of a scam, according to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scam) is "a fraudulent or deceptive act or operation", with fraudulent meaning, according to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fraudulent) means "characterized by, based on, or done by fraud : deceitful". Essentially, the goal is to decieve people into an idea. But wait, how can I prove Web 3.0 is a scam? Well when Googling "Web 3.0", just to find resources to better define Web 3.0, the first result essentially told me "Web 3.0 is a myth", which is not a good sign.

So what is Web 3.0 itself, what does it claim to be? Essentially, the "too long; didn't read" is that it's the World Wide Web but with blockchain technologies, and decenteralization. That first one, building the web off of the blockchain will probably never work as intended (Given Non-Fungble Tokens (NFTs) don't work as intended because the blockchain cannot even handle images, already a bad sign for websites), but not to mention websites have, sadly, become FAR too complex and massive for such an idea to work properly - plus... what does it mean? Does the blockchain own the website? If it does, then wouldn't that restrict access and ownership of the website and it's contents (based on the ideas of other blockchain tech like NFTs and cryptocurrency)? It doesn't make sense, and it isn't well defined ANYWHERE. But that's honestly not that bad, at compared to the other point. It's that decentralization part that really really irks me. 

The problem claiming decentralization is that it's not really decentralized. Sure it will run off the blockchain, but that's not really helpful of a point when the blockchain is heading towards centralization itself. Companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, etc will be able to control and regulate - or push for a regulative body (Which I recommend the acronym `Blockchain International Technologies Commission for Humor`) as the government itself is looking at a blockchain future, meaning it is going to be regulated. Don't believe me? Look ANYWHERE and at anything and you will see regulative bodies controlling everything. FTC - Trade. FCC - Communications & broadcasting. IANA & ICANN - Domains and DNS. IRS - Our ability to enjoy April. These regulative bodies exist to control and moderate various technologies and innovations, so it's easier for the government to use them, and to make sure illegal activity is limited.

To put it simply, once the blockchain grows it will be regulated by a centralized organization, and ran by the same few companies we have today. The only part that might happen, kinda feels like nonsense and no one seems to agree what it means - which is the internet running on a blockchain.

While I hope the blockchain gets eradicated, to be "fair" to the crypto-nuts, it is technically our future.
